1. fit a complex, multi-step electron transfer process (~15 params)
2. Show an example of a bad fit, this is what can happen.....
3. Show heuristic fit, and calculated objective function
4. Calculate objective function for (a) time domain, and (b) harmonics 1-4
5. consider the phase, show in supplimentary?
6. Key is putting prior on E0's, rescaling the liklihood function
7. Try fitting a fully reversible simulation, compare.
8. Mention that heuristic focusses on peak height. Data optimisation is not 
biased, automated and reproducible.
9. Compare Ru = 0 and Ru = 50 to show undetermined.
